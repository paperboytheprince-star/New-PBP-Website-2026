<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial high-level goal was to enhance the Paperboy Prince Platform by adding a complete Posts Experience including clickable posts, a post library, detail pages, and comments. Over the session, the requirements evolved significantly due to deployment and architectural constraints.

The key user requests addressed in this session were:
1.  **Static Site Conversion**: Re-architect the application to be a fully static site deployable on Bluehost shared hosting, removing the hard dependency on a live backend for public-facing pages.
2.  **Hosting Configuration**: Create and refine a  file to enforce HTTPS and handle SPA routing (deep linking) correctly on Apache. Configure a  file for automated deployment from a Git repository via cPanel.
3.  **Authentication Overhaul**:
    *   Initially, migrate public user authentication from a custom backend implementation to Supabase Auth.
    *   Subsequently, remove all public user authentication entirely. Join Us and Volunteer CTAs should now link to an external Google Form.
    *   Stabilize the separate admin authentication by sourcing credentials from environment variables (, ) and making the seeding process safer and non-destructive.
4.  **UI/UX Enhancements**:
    *   Implement a hero section with an auto-rotating image slideshow.
    *   Add a socialist rose SVG to the footer.
    *   Implement a lightweight, backend-powered analytics system to track page views and clicks, with an admin-only dashboard.
    *   Implement a flipping logo in the navbar, which was later changed to a pulsing animation.
    *   Add a View Counter badge to the homepage hero section.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a React frontend application configured as a static site, with an optional FastAPI backend.
-   **Deployment**: The repository is structured for deployment on Bluehost via cPanel's Git Version Control. It contains a top-level  directory with the production build output and a  file that orchestrates the deployment.
-   **Frontend**: A responsive React application built with Create React App and TailwindCSS. Public pages are static and do not require a backend to load. It features a hero slideshow, a View Counter, a pulsing logo in the navbar, and various content pages.
-   **Backend**: A FastAPI server with a MongoDB database. It provides admin-only functionality for managing posts, viewing analytics, and managing admin credentials. It is not required for the public site to function.
-   **Authentication**: Public user registration and login have been completely removed. Admin authentication is handled by the backend via a traditional email/password flow at the  route, with credentials managed by environment variables.
-   **Analytics**: A custom, lightweight analytics system is in place, capturing events (page views, clicks) and storing them in the MongoDB database. An admin-only page () exists to view this data.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing three UI changes on the homepage:
    1.  Adding a  component.
    2.  Modifying the  component in the navbar to a simple pulsing animation of the main logo.
    3.  Reordering the hero slideshow to start with a specific image and randomize the rest.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Implementation is done, but verification is pending).
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Verify Final UI Changes (P0)**
    -   The agent created , overwrote , and updated . It then ran a build but did not restart the services or take a screenshot to confirm the changes are working as expected.

    -   **Issues Detail:**
        -   **Attempted fixes:** N/A.
        -   **Next debug checklist:**
            1.  Restart the frontend service (frontend: ERROR (not running)
frontend: started).
            2.  Take a screenshot of the homepage ().
            3.  Verify the View Counter badge is visible and styled correctly.
            4.  Verify the top-left logo has a pulsing animation and no longer flips to the fist logo.
            5.  Verify the hero slideshow starts with the correct image () and continues with the others.

    -   Re-architected the frontend to be a static-first application for deployment on shared hosting.
    -   Created a  directory containing the final build artifacts for direct deployment.
    -   Configured a  file to automate deployment tasks on Bluehost.
    -   Implemented and refined a  file in the build output to enforce HTTPS and handle SPA routing.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Static-First Architecture**: React frontend that functions independently for public users, with backend features failing gracefully or being hidden.
-   **Shared Hosting Deployment**: Codebase is structured for Bluehost using cPanel Git deployment, with a pre-built  directory and  for automation.
-   **Apache Configuration**: Use of  for HTTPS enforcement and Single-Page Application (SPA) routing.
-   **Environment-Driven Config**: Admin credentials and feature flags (e.g., ) are managed via environment variables.

**key DB schema**
-   :  (Now only for admins)
-   : 
-   : 

**changes in tech stack**
-   : Added for authentication, but its usage for public login/signup has since been removed. It remains in .

**All files of reference**
-   : Defines deployment steps for Bluehost. **CRITICAL**.
-   : Live Apache configuration file. **CRITICAL**.
-   : Contains all backend logic, including admin auth, seeding, and analytics.
-   : Main homepage component with hero slideshow and view counter logic.
-   : Main site layout, including navbar and footer.
-   : New component for the view counter.
-   : New component for the pulsing logo animation.
-   : Client-side logic for tracking analytics events.
-   : New page for viewing analytics data.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file remains a large monolith.
-   Auth-related files (, , ) could be reviewed to remove any dead code from the Supabase implementation.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Creates the initial admin user. Now only active when .
-   : Endpoint for admin login.
-   : New endpoint for a logged-in admin to change their credentials.
-   : New endpoint to receive and store analytics events.
-   : New endpoint to fetch aggregated analytics data for the admin dashboard.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Deployment Model is Key**: Do not run yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. and expect the site to update. The project is designed for a specific Git-based deployment workflow on Bluehost. The  directory in the root of the repository is the deployable unit. Any changes must be committed to Git.
-   **Public Auth is GONE**: Do not attempt to implement or fix public login/signup. All Join Us / Volunteer actions should link to the specified Google Form.
-   **Admin Auth is Separate**: The backend and the  route are for admin use only. Admin credentials are now managed via environment variables and should be stable across deployments.
-   **Hosting-Level Issues**: The user has experienced issues originating from their hosting environment (e.g., Cloudflare's human verification). Be aware that not all problems are in the codebase.
